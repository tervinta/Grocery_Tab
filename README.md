# Grocery_Tab

## Description

The application is an online grocery store. The user can see the homepage, and if logged in, the user gains access to their own profile page. The profile page displays the user's own information. They also gain access to recent purchases that they may have made. There is also checkout cart functionality which holds all of the shopper's items they wish to purchase.

## Installation

To install this project, all that is required is 'npm install' at the home directory. This will install all needed dependencies. To go a step further, you can use 'npm run seed' to install the seeded data. Otherwise the application is deployed to Heroku which will not require any downloads. 

## Usage

To navigate through the project, simply use the navbar at the top of the page. It will prompt you to login, which when done, will gain you access to the rest of the site. You will see a home button which will take you to the home page. There will be a recent purchases button which will have all of your recent items purchased, and finally a profile button, which will show the user's own profile information.
